# 2008: Autonomous Buggy
 A Project to build an autonomous buggy, using hand built sensor circuits the buggy was to race around a track using the sensors to detect a guide wire.
 The goal of the project is to have a buggy able to autonomously complete the track in the shortest amount of time.
 
 This is achieved using a c++ code which controls the buggy.
 Using the data from the sensors to predict changes of direction on the track and execute motor speed and steering adjustments.
 

Includes:
1. EEE2008_Buggy_Code.cpp- Main control code written in C++
